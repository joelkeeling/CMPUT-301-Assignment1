=====================

A simple android To Do List app. Allows users to create and delete to do list items, archive to do list items, delete or unarchive archived items and email all or selected items.

To check-off items, hit the corresponding checkbox. 
To delete an active or archived item, hit the corresponding 'X' button.
To select/deselect an item, hit the corresponding text/name of the item.

Archived items have their checkboxes diabled, this was done on purpose.
'Email Selected' will email all active and all archived items that are selected even though you won't see both active and archived on the screen at the same time, this was also done on purpose.
